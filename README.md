# UFOs
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
In this week's challenge we were tasked with building a dynamic table using stored data in a JavaScript array. The data was information on UFOs that have been spotted in the United States, broken down by date, city, state, country, shape, and a comment on the UFO spotting. Before we could complete the challenge we created the base table with one filter option. Once we completed the base table and utilized it through the HTML file, it was easy to see in our web browser what we developed. What the challenge required us to complete was adding additional filter criteria to react to multiple search criteria inputed by the user. The additional filter criteria was including the rest of the keys in our UFO data JavaScript array. These additional filters would allow for the user to easily sort through the provided data using multiple criterias.

#### Further Development
After further review of this webpage and the information that is stored and provided for analysis, one drawback that has been identified is the limited data avaialble for review. This table data is solely based on information from January 2010, thus creates an extremely narrow window for analysis. Which is why there are two additional recommendations for further development as we move grow this website. To use our new filters to their fullest potential and for an overall thorough analysis, it is recommended that UFO data is comtinuously gathered and pushed to the table in the UFO site. Setting up the data collection and push process on a monthly or quarterly basis would provide the users current data as they explore the table information. The final recommendation would be to modify our input on the filters to accept and search by any text. Currently our filters are letter case specific and if the user is not aware of this setting they could be missing out on information they are looking for.
